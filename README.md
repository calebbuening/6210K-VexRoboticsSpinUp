The amazing code repo for all the PROS code of 2022-2023.

### Authors:
* Caleb Buening
* Joey Curnutt
* Eli DeKruyter?
* With Stephen Moore as a mentor

### A brief description of each folder/file

* include - All the files involving the two api's used to interact with the robot: pros and okapi
* src - our code
    * main.cpp - Currently contains our driver code

### Auton helper and AI
* To help with theoretical code, we made an auton helper. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/joeycurnutt/VexRoboticsAutonHelper) to see/use the code
* We also toyed with artificial intelligence last year and acheived VRC's first active in-match Copilot

## Research and development branch
* For more on the AI and our future plans for the auton helper, see the research-and-development branch
